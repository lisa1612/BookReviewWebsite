        <p><strong>Title:</strong> You've Reached Sam</p>
        <p><strong>Author:</strong> Dustin Thao</p>
        <p><strong>Publication date:</strong> November 9th 2021</p>

        <p><strong>Summary:</strong>
            <br><br>Seventeen-year-old Julie has her future all planned out—move out of her small town with her boyfriend Sam, attend college in the city, spend a summer in Japan. But then Sam dies. And everything changes.

            Heartbroken, Julie skips his funeral, throws out his things, and tries everything to forget him and the tragic way he died. But a message Sam left behind in her yearbook forces back memories. Desperate to hear his voice one more time, Julie calls Sam’s cellphone just to listen to his voicemail.
            
            And Sam picks up the phone.</strong>

        <p><strong>Review:</strong>
        <br><br>It's really a testament to my unending love for Sam Cortland from The Assassin's Blade that I added this to my tbr just because it has a character named Sam  </p>
