        <p><strong>Summary:</strong>

            What have we done to each other?<br>

            anniversary when his wife Amy suddenly disappears.
            The police suspect Nick. Amy's friends reveal that
             she was afraid of him, that she kept secrets from him.
             He swears it isn't true. A police examination of his
             computer shows strange searches.He says they weren't made by
             him. And then there are the persistent calls on his mobile phone.<br>
             So what did happen to Nick's beautiful wife?<br></strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Review:</strong>
        <br><br>Quite simply, this is one of the best novels of the year. It's a thriller in the best tradition of Alfred Hitchcock and layered with brilliantly written characters; it's the kind of book that's nearly impossible to put down. The surprises and twists keep the reader guessing up until the final page, and my first thought upon finishing the novel was that I wanted to read it a second time. </p>
